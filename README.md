IDEA: 
NUMBER OF ENNEMY CARDS
EACH PLAYER TAKES TURNS TRYING TO TAKE DOWN AS MANY AS POSSIBLE
ENNEMIES ARE DISPOSED IN A GRID (possibility to change size of the grid for longer or shorter games)
PLAYER CHOOSE WHAT ENNEMY THEY ATTACK
ENNMY CARDS HAVE EFFECT WHEN TAKEN DOWN (ie attack once more, take control of the ennemy, destroy the opponant card)
PLAYERS SUMMON THEIR CREATURES AND ATTACK THE ENNEMY
THE PLAYER THAT TOOK DOWN THE MOST ENNEMIES (maibe got the biggest score if ennemies gives differents scores) WINS
SPELLS CAN BE USED FROM EITHER PLAYER TURNS
